# Terraform Instance Creation

To create a virtual machine instance using Terraform, follow these steps:

1. **Install Terraform:** If you haven't already, install Terraform by following the instructions on the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

2. **Create a Configuration File:** Create a new file named `main.tf` to define your infrastructure configuration.

    ```hcl
    provider "aws" {
      region = "us-west-2"
    }

    resource "aws_instance" "example_instance" {
      ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
      instance_type = "t2.micro"
      tags = {
        Name = "ExampleInstance"
      }
    }
    ```

3. **Initialize Terraform:** Open a terminal in the same directory as your `main.tf` file and run the following commands:

    ```shell
    terraform init
    ```

4. **Preview Changes:** Run the following command to preview the changes Terraform will make:

    ```shell
    terraform plan
    ```

5. **Apply Changes:** If the preview looks good, apply the changes by running:

    ```shell
    terraform apply
    ```

6. **Destroy Resources (Optional):** If you want to destroy the created instance, you can run:

    ```shell
    terraform destroy
    ```

Remember to customize the configuration according to your needs. Once you're familiar with the basics, you can explore more advanced configurations and features that Terraform offers.
